# gesture_volume_cotrol

• Built a laptop/pc volume control model using Opencv and mediapipe, to control system volume using finger gestures.

•  Identified 21 different landmarks for hand detection using an inbuilt device camera and mapped the distances between any two specific       landmarks to the system volume range with the help of the pycaw library.
